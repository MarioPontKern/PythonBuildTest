# PythonBuildTest
Test to Workflow and to build Python
Using this as a log (I should've made pull requests and another branch, lol)
(Workflow actions seems to change the enviroment in each run without taking old builds off, which messed up trying different version with flake8 and pytest)
Pushing now
